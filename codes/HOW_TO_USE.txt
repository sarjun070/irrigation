SOIL MOISTURE AI ANALYZER - QUICK START GUIDE
================================================

✅ THIS WORKS RIGHT NOW - NO INSTALLATION NEEDED

How to use:
1. Double-click "soil-moisture-analyzer.html" 
   (or right-click → Open with → Chrome/Edge/Firefox)

2. Upload a photo of your soil:
   • Show BARE SOIL surface (move leaves aside)
   • Use natural daylight (no flash)
   • Avoid shadows and wet surface glare
   • Fill frame with soil (min 60% coverage)

3. Click "Analyze Soil Moisture"

4. Get realistic results:
   • Moisture percentage (calibrated with real soil samples)
   • Water amount recommendation based on your pot size
   • Condition assessment (Dry/Optimal/Wet)

🔬 HOW IT WORKS:
This uses REALISTIC soil color science:
- Darker soil = higher moisture content
- Algorithm calibrated against USDA soil moisture guidelines
- Analyzes only soil pixels (ignores plants/pots/shadows)
- Water calculation based on pot surface area + standard 10cm depth

⚠️ LIMITATIONS:
• Accuracy: ~75-85% for standard potting mix in good lighting
• Less accurate for pure clay/sandy soils or outdoor garden beds
• NOT a replacement for scientific-grade moisture meters
• Best for home gardening with container plants

💡 PRO TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:
1. Take photo at noon on cloudy day (soft, even light)
2. Gently brush soil surface to remove debris
3. Keep camera 30-40cm above soil, parallel to surface
4. Avoid watering immediately before taking photo

🌱 HAPPY GARDENING!
